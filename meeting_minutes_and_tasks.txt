Meeting Minutes:

The meeting commenced with an update on the financial risk assessment. The team reported a 99% confidence level indicating that the maximum loss will not exceed $5 million in the next trading day. This confidence stems from the conservative approach adopted in managing leverage and the healthy Tier 1 Capital Ratio (T1CR) of 12.5%.

The forecast for the upcoming quarter was discussed, revealing positive expectations. The team anticipates revenue to be around $135 million, marking an 8% quarter-over-quarter growth. This growth is primarily driven by the cutting-edge blockchain solutions and AI-driven predictive analytics offered by the company.

Another significant point of discussion was the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of the fintech subsidiary, Pay Plus. The team expects this IPO to raise $200 million, significantly enhancing liquidity and paving the way for aggressive growth strategies.

The meeting concluded with expressions of gratitude to shareholders for their continued faith in the company and optimism for a successful Q3.
